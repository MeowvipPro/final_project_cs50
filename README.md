BIZ QUESTIONS
Q1. "How can we help buyers search for and buy car products through a web application?"
Q2. "How can we support sellers in managing orders, reviews, and content on the web app?"
Q3. "How can we help users and sellers get quick answers and recommend them to actions?"
CS50 SOLUTION
"Web application platforms allow sellers to connect with buyers and support them in making more informed decisions when purchasing cars. 
Integrated chatbot and LLM (Large Language Model) systems help sellers provide immediate assistance by answering buyer questions and recommending suitable products in real time."

Step 1: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment: To keep your project dependencies organized and separate from system-wide packages, start by creating a virtual environment:
             py -m venv .venv
Step 2: Install Required Dependencies: Once the virtual environment is active, install all the necessary Python packages required to run the application. These are listed in the requirements.txt file.
            pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
Step 3: Run the Application: After installing the dependencies, you're ready to start the application:
            python app.py
